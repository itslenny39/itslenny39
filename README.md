### 🕑 What I'm planning to code in the future:
Right now, I plan on only making these ideas as addons for GMod:
- [X] An addon that adds variety of new STools
###### *Spoiler: addon name is "Extended STools"*
- [ ] A "context menu" options addon so you can change advanced settings on the fly
- [ ] An advanced file explorer for game & addon content
- [ ] An addon that adds variety of HUD indicators (clock, FPS, etc)
- [ ] Decoration addons
- [ ] An addon that adds more Wiremod stuff (50/50 chance of doing it)?
- [ ] Maybe a SWEP addon?

### 🍦 Fun Facts!
- My first programming language to ever learn was **Java**.
