  <p align="center">Hi there! 👋.
  I'm a young student who likes coding useful, testing, non-sense & weird stuff, and also likes Vocaloid & Project Sekai.</p>

### 💻 What I'm currently working on:

Currently nothing.

---
### 🌱 What I'm learning:

Currently not learning any new languages.

---
### 🕑 What I'm planning to code in the future:
Right now, I plan on only making these ideas as addons for GMod:
- [X] A simple prop precision addon
- [ ] A "context menu" options addon so you can change advanced settings on the fly
- [ ] An advanced file explorer for game & addon content
- [ ] An addon that adds safety signs
- [ ] An addon that adds more Wiremod stuff (50/50 chance of doing it)?

---
### 🍦 Fun Facts!
- My first programming language to ever learn was **Java**.

And that's all! Thanks for reading!
