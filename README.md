  <p align="center">Hi there! üëã.
  I'm a young student who likes coding useful, testing, non-sense & weird stuff, and also likes Vocaloid & Project Sekai.</p>
</p>

### üíª What I'm currently working on:

A GMod addon that adds a variety of STools that are for utility, useless stuff (i know), and some tools for entertainment purposes!

---
### üå± What I'm learning:

I'm learning GLua for coding addons in GMod. Still in the basics but learning something new every day.
##### (GLua is a modified version of Lua exclusive to GMod)

---
### üïë What I'm planning to code in the future:
Right now, I plan on only making these ideas as addons for GMod:
- [X] An addon that adds variety of new STools
###### *Spoiler: addon name is "Extended STools"*
- [ ] A "context menu" options addon so you can change advanced settings on the fly
- [ ] An advanced file explorer for game & addon content
- [ ] An addon that adds variety of HUD indicators (clock, FPS, etc)
- [ ] Decoration addons
- [ ] An addon that adds more Wiremod stuff (50/50 chance of doing it)?
- [ ] Maybe a SWEP addon?

---
### üì∫ My YouTube career:

I been doing YouTube all the way back in 2017, then centered on fun or interesting PowerPoints, and Garry's Mod.

#### I'm working to make new quality content & series for the channel for this year (aka. try to do something else rather than gmod).
